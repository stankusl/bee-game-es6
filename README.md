ECMA Script 6 Bee Game


The	Bee	Game
Objective
You	have	24	hours to	complete	the	following	task:
• The	objective	of	this	exercise	is	to	create	a	mini-game	using	a	PHP-based	backend	with	a	Javascriptbased
frontend.
• A	web	page	must	be	produced	as	the	interface	to	play	the	game.	Styling	is	not	expected	nor	necessary.
• A	button	must	be	present	to	kick	off	the	process	of	hitting	a	random	bee.
• The	game	must	follow	the	specification	below.
Specification
1. Queen	Bee
The	Queen	Bee	has	a	lifespan	of	100	Hit	Points.	When	the	Queen	Bee	is	hit,	8	Hit	Points are	deducted	from	her	
lifespan.
If/when	the	Queen	Bee	has	run	out	of	Hit	Points,	all	remaining	alive	Bees	automatically	run	out	of	hit	points.
• There	is	only	1	Queen	Bee.
2. Worker	Bee
• Worker	Bees	have	a	lifespan	of	75	Hit	Points.
• When	a	Worker	Bee	is	hit,	10	Hit	Points are	deducted	from	his	lifespan.
• There	are	5	Worker	Bees.
3. Drone	Bee
• Drone	Bees	have	a	lifespan	of	50	Hit	Points.
• When	a	Drone	Bee	is	hit,	12	Hit	Points are deducted	from	his	lifespan.
• There	are	8	Drone	Bees.
Gameplay
To	play,	there	must	be	a	button	that	enables	a	user	to	“hit”	a	random	bee.	The	selection	of	a	bee	must	be	
random.
When	all	the	Bees	are	dead,	the	game	must	be	able	to	reset	itself	with	full	life	Bees	for	another	round.
Constraints
• The	application	must	run	through	a	browser.
• All	code	must	be	submitted	to	work	in	a	local	environment.	Hosted	solutions	will	be	rejected.
• A	‘readme’	file	must	be	provided	with	instructions	of	use.
